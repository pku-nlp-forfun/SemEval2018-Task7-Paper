First, we test the performance with some naive ideas to transform the problem into a trainable form. Then sifting out the unfeasible one and bad performance one. Doing some research on previous competitors' paper. Then we decide to follow the LightRel model. We looking for the most important factors that affect the performance the most. Finally, focusing on them and aim to gain more improvement on the Macro F1 score.

We achieve a 56.3\% F1 score on Task 1.1. And it beats the best performance of the LightRel 46.4\%.
