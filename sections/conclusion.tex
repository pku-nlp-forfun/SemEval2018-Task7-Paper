\label{sec:conclusion_and_future_work}
In this paper, we introduce a domain-specific semantic relation classification model base on fuse end-to-end method and traditional feature engineer to reduce propagation of implicit error. The framework is based on LightRel model [1]. FastText is the best way in our jobs on the embedding layer. The TextCNN would have a better effect than other models in this task especially in subTask1.1. The cluster, pad position, and one-hot also have some effect in this model. We achieve a 67.74\% F1 score on Task 1.1, 77.35\% in Task1.2. And it beats the best performance of the LightRel 39.9\% in Task1.1, 68.2\% in Task1.2. Compare with the results of the competition, our model gets No.8 in subTask1.1, No.7 in subTask1.2.  Evaluation shows that our approach better than LightRel.
