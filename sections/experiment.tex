\section{Experiment}
\label{sec:experiment}

In the previous section, we mentioned many experiments on the different corpus, embedding tools and model. We will list the performance of each attempt and highlight the best performance on both tasks.

Because the TOPIC class in subtask 1.1 is unbalanced. So we can see the phenomenon that subtask 1.2 will overall be higher than subtask 1.1.
